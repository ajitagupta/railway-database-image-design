# Image Design Of A Railway Database Management System
A database is key to every software. Database is a collection of interrelated data which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from the database and organizes the data in the form of tables, views, schemas, reports, etc. For example, a railway database organizes the data about trains, passengers, admin staff, etc. which helps in the efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of data from it.

## Database Management System
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database. DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL). In RDBMS the data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data is related to each other through primary and foreign keys.
